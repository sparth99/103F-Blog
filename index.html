Facebook and other data driven technology companies have recently been under a lot of scrutiny for their use and gathering of data. Facebook collects browsing, financial information, and even creates shadow profiles, profiles for people who do not have an account. Facebook has turned this information to apps, which are the epitome of exploitation. Although collection data can be helpful to providing a better experience for users, it can also cause dangerous breaches, such as the one with Cambridge Analytics. Our group believes Facebook and other tech companies should explicitly explain their data practices.

<br>
Data collections and breaches have a fairly negative effect on society. In the past couple years, we have seen many instances in which large tech companies have used the customer information for its own purposes. Users who buy their products unintentionally become products themselves: individuals become targets for ads that bring in more revenue to the companies. With our high dependence on technology, society is ultimately within the grasp of giant monopolies as well. 
<br>
<br>
Tech companies like Facebook provide many free services to users, such as being able to socialize online, in exchange for information on its users. However, Facebook has ignored the duty it holds to its user base by profiteering under a consequence based framework that wants to squeeze out as much exploitable data as possible under a pretense of going unnoticed and unhindered.
<br>
<br>
Collecting data isn’t inherently wrong, but with companies as massive and influential as those in the tech industry are, a certain degree of transparency and information is required to assure that data isn’t being gathered unethically or for dangerous purposes.
Distributing data can make the information more vulnerable to data breaches; government investigation is crucial to monitoring data collection and usage practices. We believe informed consent should be made very explicit and easily understandable by all types of different people. Even as millennials, trying to recall Facebook’s privacy settings felt unclear. When users install the app, all data collection policies should be shown and users should have the ability to easily disable settings that they are not comfortable with.
