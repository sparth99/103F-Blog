Hacktivism separates society into the people who were targeted and those who support the cause of the hacks. To the victims of the attacks such as large corporations or national governments, they view the hacking as harmful, as the attack resulted in an unnecessary loss of money and reputation. On the other hand, since such hacking usually becomes frontline news, the cause for which the hackers act becomes broadcasted to the public. Hacktivism hopes to polarize the opinions of the public over the cause, potentially even swaying individuals to join their group of “hackers with a cause”. Our group believes that even though it is beneficial to encourage individuals to act for a cause, it is ultimately more harmful to society when companies and governments are successfully attacked, bringing panic to the public.

Hacktivism is ethical when a message is being voiced, as opposed to causing high financial loss or destruction to a company or government. From a duty-based ethical framework, many hackers, such as those in LulzSec or Anonymous, believe it is their responsibility to bring awareness of several issues to the public. For instance, during the Tunisian Revolution, the group Anonymous voiced their support for the protestors by helping them overcome government firewalls. On the other hand, some hacking attacks can cause direct harm, such as the attack on Sony by LulzSec that costed the company over a hundred million dollars. From a consequentialist framework, more harm resulted from the attack than simply broadcasting a message, and we believe this type of hacktivism is unethical
<br>
<br>
A bystander views actions of a hacktivist group differently, depending on whether or not they agree with the cause of the group. Often times, a hacktivist will always somehow negatively affect another group so it is very subjective. For example, Edward Snowden is a witness to a hacktivist group. We can see the NSA as a type of hacktivist group. They hack into computers and use gathered intelligence to prevent terrorist attacks and more. However, they are still invading other people's privacy. In my perspective, I do not think NSA is at fault. Using hacking for the purpose of protecting the greater good is completely ethical even though some people's’ privacy may be disrupted. However if any of the data is leaked and not secure, I would classify it as unethical.

Facebook and other data driven technology companies have recently been under a lot of scrutiny for their use and gathering of data. Facebook collects browsing, financial information, and even creates shadow profiles, profiles for people who do not have an account. Facebook has turned this information to apps, which are the epitome of exploitation. Although collection data can be helpful to providing a better experience for users, it can also cause dangerous breaches, such as the one with Cambridge Analytics. Our group believes Facebook and other tech companies should explicitly explain their data practices. 
<br>
<br>
Data collections and breaches have a fairly negative effect on society. In the past couple years, we have seen many instances in which large tech companies have used the customer information for its own purposes. Users who buy their products unintentionally become products themselves: individuals become targets for ads that bring in more revenue to the companies. With our high dependence on technology, society is ultimately within the grasp of giant monopolies as well. 
<br>
<br>
Tech companies like Facebook provide many free services to users, such as being able to socialize online, in exchange for information on its users. However, Facebook has ignored the duty it holds to its user base by profiteering under a consequence based framework that wants to squeeze out as much exploitable data as possible under a pretense of going unnoticed and unhindered.
<br>
<br>
Collecting data isn’t inherently wrong, but with companies as massive and influential as those in the tech industry are, a certain degree of transparency and information is required to assure that data isn’t being gathered unethically or for dangerous purposes.
Distributing data can make the information more vulnerable to data breaches; government investigation is crucial to monitoring data collection and usage practices. We believe informed consent should be made very explicit and easily understandable by all types of different people. Even as millennials, trying to recall Facebook’s privacy settings felt unclear. When users install the app, all data collection policies should be shown and users should have the ability to easily disable settings that they are not comfortable with.
